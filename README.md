Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs
and Os, is a two-player paper-and-pencil game in
which each player takes turns marking an X or O
square on a 3 x 3 grid. The winner is the player who
successfully places 3 markers in a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal row. This fun 2D array game of his can be
implemented in the C programming language. Using
arrays is important when creating a tic-tac-toe game in
the C programming language.
